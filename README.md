Add a level of complexity. The example uses two ways of expansion: replacing a general word with one of several specific ones; replacing a single word with multiple ones of the same type: (adventurer --> Jack, Jill, and Bob). Add one additional type of replacement. In your README, specify what it is. (3 pts)
    The set of text I wrote takes much more advantage of CFGs and how they can be used, permitting for items to be replaced by storylets to keep details consistent. For example, a Scallywag cant tell you to walk the plank no matter how much you want them to.

artist statement: What is the effect you're trying to achieve? Did you achieve that effect? If not, what was the difficulty/limitation with tools, and what did you end up doing? (This last bit might be more relevant with later, more complex assignments.) (2 pts)
    The idea was to express two separate storylets that keep details consistent. But it ended up turning into an exceedingly high amount of writing to potentially do more than just a sentence of generation with the structure I was working by. The idea was to have it create some sort of humorous statement or strong opinion on which Mass Effect game is the best. As stated, the main issue with this, and the added level of complexity I made, was that the amount of writing I would need to do would be monumental, and is likely the reason why more condensed forms of generative writing now exist.
